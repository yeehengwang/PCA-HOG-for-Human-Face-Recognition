# PCA-HOG-for-Human-Face-Recognition
Face recognition is a very typical task for machine learning research. In this project, we use two methods, Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Principal Component Analysis, to process the initial face images. SVM is used as a baseline classifier throughout the study.
